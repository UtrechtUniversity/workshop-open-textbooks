## The Tools You Need...

- Quarto works with R and/or Python, plus their related _editors_. 

Note that for a book project, you won't have to do much programming per se.

- You'll want to set up _Version Control_ with Git to make full use of it's capabilities. 

# Let's Get Started!

## Create A Quarto Book Project

1. To create a new book project within RStudio, use the **New Project** command and select **Quarto Book**.

2. Then, provide a directory name and other relevant options for the book.

3. Edit the `_quarto.yml` to specify `output-dir: docs`. Optionally, comment out the `pdf` options to keep things quick.

4. Click the **Render** button to preview the book.

## So What Just Happened

Let's take a look!

```
my-open-textbooks
    > cover.png
    > index.qmd
    > intro.qmd
    > my-open-textbook.Rproj
    > references.bib
    > references.qmd
    > summary.qmd
    > _quarto.yml
```

- `my-open-textbook.Rproj`: The R project file, use this to open your project everytime you want to work on it.

- `_quarto.yml`: The Quarto project file, contains configuration details and metadata.

- `qmd` files: These are your chapters.

- `references.bib`: The bibliography file.

## Workflow

- `quarto preview`: Terminal command to preview the book.

- `quarto render`: Terminal command to render the book (all output formats specified in `_quarto.yml`).

- `quarto render --to pdf`: Terminal command to render the to a specific format (other options: `docx`, `html`, `epub`).

# Let's Git This Book Online!

## From Your Computer To The World... { .smaller}

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/) and create a new repository called `my-open-textbook`

_Do not select any of the options (README, License, .gitignore)_

Make sure your repository is set to _Public_ visibility.

2. Go to your repository's settings and find the options for _GitHub Pages_.

Set the GitHub Pages source as the `main` repository and `docs` folder.

3. Go back to the main page for your repsitory and select _Upload Files_

We are simply going to drag and drop the contents of our local folder to GitHub and save it with a _commit_ message.

4. If all goes well, your book will be online in a minute! The URL will be: `your-username.github.io/my-open-textbook`

# Let's Play Around With Our Textbook

## Exercises {.smaller .scrollable}

1. Make a new `qmd` file and name it `episode-5.qmd` 

2. Copy the text from `workshop-materials/episode-t.txt` into the chapter and save it.

3. Use [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to turn some text bold. For example, **GALACTIC EMPIRE** & **DEATH STAR**.

4. Use [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to embed the `episode-5.jpg` image into the chapter.

5. Use [Markdown Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to embed some links into the chapter. Refer to `workshop-materials/links.txt`

6. Add a disclaimer/copyright notice in the form of a Quarto _call-out block_. Copy it from `workshop-materials/copyright.txt`.

7. Copy the BibText key from `workshop-materials/reference.txt` into the `references.bib` of your book. Cite the reference somewhere in your chapter.

8. Update `_quarto.yml` to include the new chapter.

9. Render the book to HTML using `quarto preview` first and then `quarto render`.

10. Drag and drop the `docs` folder to GitHub.
